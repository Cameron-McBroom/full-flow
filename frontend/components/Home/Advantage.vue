      High pressure is great for clearing away dirt, muck and mould.
      However, many surfaces can be brittle and damaged by the use of really high pressure.
      The mastery of exterior cleaning is achieved when you understand the surface and know the right pressure,
      chemicals and techniques to clean the surface without damage as well as prolong surface life.
